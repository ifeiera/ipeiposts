# Introduction

A technical exploration of modern anti-cheat systems and their implementation.

## Key Components
Here we discuss the main components of an anti-cheat system.

### Kernel-Level Protection
Understanding how kernel-level drivers work in anti-cheat systems.

Some code example:
`kernel.sys`


```typescript
interface CodeBlockProps {
    children: string;
    className?: string;
    language?: string;
}
```

> Note: This is a complex topic that requires deep understanding of system architecture.

Some **important points** about kernel-level drivers:
- **Security**: Must handle sensitive system resources
- **Performance**: Need to be highly optimized
- **Stability**: Cannot afford to crash

You can also use it __inline__ with regular text.

# Anti-Cheat Architecture

Here's a high-level overview of how anti-cheat systems work:

The diagram above shows the interaction between kernel and user space components.
